# 11, The Editor UI & Annotations (Text, Arrows, Highlights)

Vuoom's editor must be **simple, clean, and "looks good by default"**, a focused demo-GIF
editor, *not* a video NLE. This doc covers the editing UI layout, the minimal tool set, the
interaction patterns, and how text/arrow/highlight annotations are rendered in the wgpu pipeline.

> Guiding philosophy (from every successful tool in the space): **automate first, allow manual
> override second.** A user should be able to record → export a beautiful GIF without touching a
> single control. Editing is for polish, not for assembly.

## 1. The minimal tool set (this is the whole list, resist adding more)

1. **Trim**, in/out handles on the timeline. The single most-used edit.
2. **Zoom-region edit**, auto-zoom blocks (from clicks) + "add zoom at playhead"; edit
   level/position/timing. The killer feature. (See [`04`](./04-Input-and-AutoZoom.md).)
3. **Text labels** ⭐, the headline new feature. Add, position, font/size/color, and timing
   (appear/disappear + fade).
4. **Arrow** and **highlight box**, the basic annotation set. (Optional: spotlight/blur region.)
5. **Background + padding + rounded corners**, already in the compositor; exposed as a few
   presets + sliders.
6. **Speed-up dead time**, accelerate/skip idle stretches. Big perceived-quality win, low UI cost.
7. **Crop / aspect ratio**, presets: 16:9, 9:16, 1:1 (README / social).
8. **GIF export panel**, dimensions, fps, loop, quality, with a **live size estimate**.

**Deliberately left out** (to stay simple): multi-track timeline, audio, webcam, transitions
library, AI captions, layers/blend modes, color grading, bezier keyframe curve editors. Screen
Studio is praised precisely for *not* being a full editor, hold that line.

## 2. Layout, single window, record → edit → export

```

- **Canvas top, timeline bottom, one context-sensitive properties panel** on the right. This is
  the consistent pattern across Screen Studio, Cap, and screen-demo. The properties panel shows
  *only* the selected element's controls, never a permanent wall of options.
- **Strong defaults**: on entering the editor, a nice background gradient, padding, rounded
  corners, and auto-zoom are **already applied**. The empty/first-run state already looks great.

## 3. Interaction patterns (use conventions users already know, Figma/Canva)

**Text on the canvas:**
- **Click-to-add** an auto-sizing text box (or click-drag for fixed width).
- **Double-click to edit inline** on the canvas; **drag to move**; **corner handles to
  resize/scale**; optional snap/alignment guides.
- Font / size / color / weight live in the **properties panel**, bound to the selection, updating
  the preview in real time.
- The text's **time range** is a bar on the timeline, drag the ends to set when it appears /
  disappears; a small toggle for fade in/out.

**Arrows & highlight boxes:**
- Pick the tool, **drag on the canvas** to draw (arrow = drag from tail to head; box = drag a
  rect). Re-select to move/resize via handles. Color/thickness in the properties panel. Same
  timeline time-range bar as text.

**Zoom keyframes on the timeline:**
- Auto-generated zoom **blocks** appear on the timeline. **Drag a block** to retime it, **drag its
  edges** to change duration, edit **level/target** in the panel (or drag the zoom focus on the
  canvas). Vuoom interpolates smooth zoom/pan between blocks automatically, the user never
  touches raw curves.

## 4. Non-destructive, two-pass model (architecture)

Everything is non-destructive: capture stores the **near-lossless intermediate + the input/event
metadata**; every edit (zoom, text, arrow, trim, speed, background) is just **parameters** in the
`.vuoom` project. Rendering at any time `t`, for **scrubbing** and for **deterministic GIF
export**, is the *same* `render(t)` code path. This makes re-editing and re-exporting trivial and
lossless. (See [`02`](./02-Architecture.md), [`05`](./05-Compositing-and-Preview.md).)

## 5. Rendering annotations in the wgpu compositor

All annotations are drawn **on top** of the composited frame, in the same wgpu pass, with a
permissive (Apache/MIT) crate stack, **zero AGPL/GPL contamination**:

| Annotation | Crate | License | How |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Text labels** | **glyphon** 0.9.x (+ cosmic-text) | Apache-2.0 / MIT / zlib | "Bring your own wgpu" middleware, `prepare()` (CPU layout/raster/atlas) then `render()` into the existing render pass. Multi-line, color emoji, per-span color, clip bounds, runtime font loading. |
| **Arrows, highlight boxes, spotlight outline** | **lyon** (`lyon_tessellation`) | MIT / Apache-2.0 | Tessellate strokes/fills → triangles → a trivial wgpu pipeline. Arrow = stroked polyline + triangle head; box = stroked/filled rounded rect; spotlight = full-screen dim quad with a punched-out rounded rect. |
| **Blur / spotlight region** | your own wgpu shader |, | After compositing to a texture, run a small box/gaussian blur (or dim-mask) sampling that texture, masked to the lyon rounded-rect region. |

### Why this stack

- **glyphon** is the modern standard for text-in-wgpu, actively maintained, triple-licensed, and
  integrates *without adding a separate render pass*. Rejected alternatives: `wgpu_text`/`wgpu_glyph`
  (no real shaping, no emoji), raw `cosmic-text` (you'd reimplement glyphon), and **vello** (the
  appealing "one renderer for text+shapes" option, but **still alpha / blur in progress** in
  mid-2026, revisit in ~a year).
- **lyon** is tessellation-only (backend-agnostic), so it slots into our own wgpu pipeline; it
  ships a wgpu example.
- **CPU fallback** if the wgpu shape pipeline gets fiddly: render annotations with
  `tiny-skia` + `cosmic-text` to an RGBA buffer and composite that as one texture. Simplest to
  reason about; costs a per-change CPU raster + upload. Keep as a backup, not the default.

### Keyframed / animated annotations (appear, move, fade), keep it on the CPU

Don't pull an animation framework. Model each annotation as
`{ start, end, fade_in, fade_out, keyframes… }` in the timeline. Each render frame, compute
current `opacity / position / scale` from the playhead via lerp/ease, then:

- feed `opacity` into the glyph color **alpha** (cosmic-text per-span / `TextArea` color) and into
  the shape pipeline's uniform;
- only re-run glyphon `prepare()` when **text content or layout** changes, fades are just alpha,
  moves are just `TextArea.left/top`, both cheap.

The timeline is the single source of truth; scrubbing and export share the identical `render(t)`.

### Performance notes

- glyphon layout/raster is CPU-side, negligible for static labels; don't re-`prepare()` every frame.
- For **export**, rasterize text at the **export resolution** (don't scale glyphs up, avoids blur
  and atlas churn). Keep the `Viewport`/`Resolution` in sync with canvas size and DPI.

## 6. Reference products to emulate

- **Screen Studio**, defaults + the simple "drag zooms on a timeline" model (the gold standard).
- **Cap (cap.so)**, panel layout & studio-mode structure (⛔ AGPL, *design* reference only).
- **screen-demo (njraladdin, MIT)**, closest analog on our exact stack; notably it has **no
  text/annotations**, so leading with clean text + arrows is a real differentiator.
