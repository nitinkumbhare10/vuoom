# 00, Research Index & Executive Summary

**Status:** Research complete · **Date:** 2026-06-08 · **Platform:** Windows 10/11 first

This document is the **single entry point** to Vuoom's engineering knowledge base. It summarizes
every major technical decision, links to the deep-dive doc for each, and records the open
questions. Everything here is backed by primary-source research (Microsoft docs, the wgpu/Tauri
repos, and direct reading of the **Cap** open-source codebase, which is the closest comparable
product). Source URLs live in each detailed doc.

## The one reference that matters most: Cap (cap.so)

[**Cap**](https://github.com/CapSoftware/Cap) is an open-source **Tauri 2 + Rust + wgpu**
cross-platform screen recorder that shipped Screen-Studio-style auto-zoom in **Feb 2026**. It is
almost exactly Vuoom's stack and goals. Across every research area, Cap's source code validated
the architecture we'd independently arrived at. **We study Cap heavily**, its crate layout,
its `zoom.rs` spring constants, its `frame_ws.rs` preview transport, its `enc-mediafoundation`
encoder selection.

> ⚠️ **Licensing line in the sand:** Cap's *application* code is **AGPLv3**. We may **read and
> learn** from it, but we must **never copy AGPL code** into a permissively-licensed Vuoom.
> Some Cap sub-crates (`scap`, `cap-camera*`) are MIT and *are* reusable. See
> [`10-Licensing.md`](./10-Licensing.md). This is the most important constraint in the whole project.

## Decision log (the TL;DR of every doc)

| Area | Decision | Primary choice | Fallback | Detail |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Screen capture** | Native WGC, keep frames on GPU | **`windows-capture` 2.0.0** (MIT) | DXGI Desktop Duplication (in same crate) → raw `windows-rs` WGC | [03](./03-Capture.md) |

| **GIF encoding** | High quality, small | **`gifski`** as an **out-of-process binary** (keeps Vuoom Apache-2.0) | `gif` + `color_quant` (lower quality) | [06](./06-Export.md), [10](./10-Licensing.md) |
| **Text + annotations** | Simple, permissive, in-pipeline | **glyphon** (text) + **lyon** (arrows/boxes) | tiny-skia + cosmic-text (CPU) | [11](./11-Editor-and-Annotations.md) |

| **Distribution** | Avoid SmartScreen on a free app | **NSIS installer + Azure Trusted Signing** (cloud HSM) | OV cert (reputation builds over time) | [02](./02-Architecture.md) |
| **Vuoom's own license** | Free + permissive + patent grant | **Apache-2.0** ✅ |, | [10](./10-Licensing.md) |

## The five hardest problems (and where they're solved)

1. **Auto-zoom that looks professional, not janky** → the make-or-break feature. Solved with
   click-clustering + critically-damped springs + a camera clamp that never reveals off-screen
   area. Cap's exact spring constants are documented. → [`04`](./04-Input-and-AutoZoom.md)

2. **Getting 60fps preview frames to the webview** without choking JSON IPC → offscreen wgpu
   render → RGBA readback → **localhost binary WebSocket** → Web Worker → WebGPU canvas. Proven by
   Cap at sustained 60fps, ~10-15ms end-to-end. → [`05`](./05-Compositing-and-Preview.md)

3. **Zero-copy capture→GPU→compositor** → keep frames as D3D11 textures; bridge to the wgpu DX12
   compositor via an NT shared handle + keyed mutex; everything stays **RGBA** end-to-end (GIF-only
   needs no YUV conversion). → [`03`](./03-Capture.md), [`05`](./05-Compositing-and-Preview.md)

4. **Small, high-quality GIF export, license-clean** → GIF-only v1 erases the video-codec patent
   minefield entirely. Use **gifski** for quality, shipped as an **out-of-process binary** so
   Vuoom's code stays **Apache-2.0** despite gifski being AGPL. → [`06`](./06-Export.md), [`10`](./10-Licensing.md)

5. **Frame-accurate input↔video sync across mixed-DPI multi-monitor** → one QPC clock for both;
   Per-Monitor-DPI-Aware-V2; store all input in physical virtual-desktop pixels. → [`02`](./02-Architecture.md), [`04`](./04-Input-and-AutoZoom.md)

## Open questions carried forward

**Resolved by the owner (2026-06-08):** ✅ License = **Apache-2.0** · ✅ Output = **GIF-only** (MP4
dropped from v1) · ✅ **No audio** · ✅ gifski isolated as an out-of-process binary · ✅ **Text +
basic annotations are core v1 features** with a clean, simple editor.

Still open, tracked with full context in [`09-Decisions-and-Open-Questions.md`](./09-Decisions-and-Open-Questions.md):

1. **Minimum Windows version**, Win10 1809+ vs Win11-only. Borderless capture (no yellow
   border) and dirty-region APIs need Win11; decide whether those are launch features.
2. **Preview at 4K**, raw RGBA over WebSocket is heavy at 4K60; drop to half-res or switch that
   path to WebCodecs. Decide the threshold.
3. **Reserve naming/handles**, `github.com/vuoom`, a `vuoom.app`/`vuoom.dev` domain, social
   handles (launch blocker, not technical).

## How to use this knowledge base (for the implementing agent)

- Read this index, then [`01-Tech-Stack.md`](./01-Tech-Stack.md) and [`02-Architecture.md`](./02-Architecture.md) for the lay of the land.
- Before writing the make-or-break milestone, internalize [`04-Input-and-AutoZoom.md`](./04-Input-and-AutoZoom.md), it contains the actual algorithm and default parameters.
- Every doc ends with a **Sources** section. Claims are cited; verify anything load-bearing
  against the live source before hard-coding (especially Cap's constants, they iterate fast).
- The build order and acceptance gates are in [`08-Roadmap.md`](./08-Roadmap.md).
