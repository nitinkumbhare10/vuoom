//! A drag "wall" that keeps the recording panel out of the recorded region.
//!
//! Ground truth (verified on real hardware): on Windows 10 a capture-excluded window
//! (`WDA_EXCLUDEFROMCAPTURE`) that overlaps the captured area is recorded as a solid BLACK
//! rectangle, Win10 does not re-composite the desktop behind the excluded window the way
//! Win11 does. So exclusion alone is NOT enough on Win10: the panel must physically stay
//! outside the recorded region. (The region-border strips are safe only because they sit
//! just OUTSIDE the crop, not because exclusion reveals what's behind them.)
//!
//! Rather than let the user drop the panel inside the region and then snap it away (jarring,
//! and the reason the earlier debounced-snap approach was reverted), we constrain the drag
//! itself. We subclass the main window and clamp `WM_MOVING`: Windows hands us the proposed
//! window rect during its own modal move loop (the frontend's drag region initiates it via
//! `WM_NCLBUTTONDOWN`/HTCAPTION), we push that rect out of the forbidden zone along the axis
//! of least penetration and write it back, returning TRUE. The panel slides along the region
//! edge like it hit a wall, flicker-free and native-feeling.
//!
//! The subclass proc is a raw C callback, so it reads a process-global snapshot of the
//! forbidden rect (set at install time). The region is fixed for the recording's duration,
//! so a snapshot is correct. Install/remove are marshaled onto the UI thread with
//! `run_on_main_thread` because `SetWindowSubclass` must run on the window's owning thread
//! and the record-flow commands are `async` (they run off the main thread).
